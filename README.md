# ü¶Ä Practical Statistics for Data Scientists 

This is a repository for practice with the book _'Practical Statistics for Data Scientists- 2E, 2020, O'REILLY'._

I decided to study this book for upgrading the knowledge and solving the curiosity about statistics.

+‚ò∫Ô∏è I hope I can handle the codes in R beyond python after studying this book.
